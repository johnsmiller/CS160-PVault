Finally:
This project was produced as a class project, aspiring to meet certain requirements. 
Under no circumstances should this app be considered a proper implementation of 
security features, though, at conception, it was meant to. These features,
such as not storing encryption passwords (refuted by professor's requirements for 
password reset without data loss), actual encryption implementation (time restraints),
a better user interface and interactions (image display, gallery functions, login 
behavior), and others, would have been properly implemented if I was not working on
7 to 14 android apps throughout the semester.

I would love to make this a useable/functional app that would serve the masses, but
that is a pipe dream at this point. Maybe in the not-to-distant future...
